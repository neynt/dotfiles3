## dotfiles3

Dotfiles that I can take anywhere.

Files in this directory should be placed relative to ~.

To install a file or directory:

```
$ ./install.sh .vimrc
$ ./install.sh .vim/colors
```

To take control of an existing file or directory:

```
$ ./take.sh ~/.vimrc
$ ./take.sh ~/.vim/colors
```
